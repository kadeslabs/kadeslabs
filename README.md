# ✧ KADES | Kinetic Anomaly Detection Engine System 

**Where AI meets crypto chaos.**

We build high-performance AI systems for detecting on-chain anomalies, social signal distortions, and behavioral exploits in real time.

---

## 🛰 What We Do

KADES is a hybrid AI-powered anomaly detection stack designed for the modern crypto battlefield. 
We fuse time series modeling, graph theory, and NLP to expose:

- 🧬 Coordinated wallet behavior
- 📊 Insider accumulation & wash trading
- 💥 Predictive volatility zones
- 🐋 Stealth whale patterns
- 📡 Social sentiment manipulation

---

## 🧩 Core Modules

Our architecture is modular, scalable, and battle-tested:

- **Chain Analysis Engine** — Tracks liquidity flows, cyclic trades & wash loops via Solana nodes.
- **Signal Fusion Layer** — Merges NLP-derived social sentiment with real-time on-chain data.
- **Volatility Predictor** — LSTM-based short-term market anomaly forecasting.
- **Whale Intelligence** — Detects strategic whale activity & early pump signals.
- **Risk Scoring System** — Composite metrics for behavioral risk & sentiment instability.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

We operate at the intersection of AI, distributed systems, and data viz:

- **Languages**: Python, TypeScript
- **ML**: PyTorch, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow
- **NLP**: BERT, Word2Vec, spaCy
- **Data**: Web3.py, Solana RPC, PostgreSQL, Redis, WebSockets
- **Viz**: Plotly, D3.js, Flask, React

## 📡 Output Interfaces

- 🔥 Real-time anomaly dashboards (Flask + Plotly)
- 📊 Interactive graphs and liquidity maps
- ⚡ JSON APIs for integration with bots and trading tools
- 🌐 Modular frontends for exploratory data analysis

---

## 🔐 Trust Through Transparency

- End-to-end logging & validation
- Robust test coverage (unit + integration)
- Full documentation & modular open-source ethos
- Security-first design patterns

---

## 🧭 Our Ethos

We're building in the open to bring transparency to a market where opacity reigns. 
Every pattern we surface pushes crypto closer to signal over noise.
